Online coding challenges of different kinds.

# Project Euler
Well-known [math problems](https://projecteuler.net/) of varying difficulty.

## Problem 1
A warmup problem; we make sure not to double count multiples of both 3 and 5. It's fizzbuzz!

## Split Strings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:
```
'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```
