# challenges
Online coding challenges of different kinds.

# Project Euler
Well-known [math problems](https://projecteuler.net/) of varying difficulty.

## Problem 1
A warmup problem; we make sure not to double count multiples of both 3 and 5. It's fizzbuzz!

## Split Strings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:
```
'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```

## Square Every Digit
In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
